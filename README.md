# Learning-Gait-with-Reinforcement-Learning
Learning 3D gait for wheeled vehicles, six legged models, and quadrupedal models using Q-Learning and other Reinforcement Learning techniques


Uses Gazebo (an ROS package) for physics simulation.
Must have Gazebo installed. (make sure Ruby is up to date) and have a C++ compiler (make sure XCode is up to date)

To run create a build folder following the instructions here: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=animated_box
